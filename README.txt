Hello, this is a brief description for our files.

To see the sign-in/register page, you have to click on the tab "Home" or "Contact", then click on the tab"Account".
To see the user dashboard page, you have to click on the tab "Services" or "Request a service", then click on the tab"Account".

The reason why it is prgrammed like this is because we wanted to make that if the user is already logged in, when the user clicks 
on the tab "Account", it automatically navigates to the user's dashboard account. In case the user is not logged in, when the user
clicks on the tab "Account", it should automatically naviguate them to the sign-in page. Of course, since we only did the 
front-end, we couldn't code it
